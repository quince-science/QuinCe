    "# Working out measurement timings and interpolation for sensors\n",
    "This notebook is developed to show how QuinCe handles different intervals of taking measurements used by various sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is rarely a problem for ships which have the power to operate continuously, taking regular measurements (e.g. every minute). However, many moorings have limited power, so will either take one measurement every few hours or take a group of measurements before sleeping for a period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General principle\n",
    "Assuming that QuinCe is taking a carbon dioxide measurement, it will look for corresponding measurements for other required parameters (e.g. SST, Salinity) at the same time. If no such measurement exists, QuinCe will look for measurements either side of the CO₂ measurement within five minutes and perform a simple linear interpolation to estimate the value at the required time. If no such measurements are available, the measurement is not processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instruments that take measurements at extended intervals, the five minute limit is not suitable. QuinCe must therefore detect this situation and act differently. There are a number of measurements regimes that must be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular measurements at short intervals (< 5 minutes)\n",
    "- Regular single measurements at long intervals (> 5 minutes)\n",
    "- Groups of measurements at long intervals (e.g. 5 measurements at one minute intervals, every 4 hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "QuinCe will interpolate values differently for each of these situatons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular measurements at short intervals (CONTINUOUS mode)\n",
    "QuinCe will find the closest value before and after the required time within five minutes, and perform a linear interpolation between them. If a found value is not flagged Good, it will look for further values within five minutes. If no such value is found, it will use either a Questionable or Bad value within five minutes (and flag the calculation result accordingly), or not perform the calculation if there are no available values at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular single measurements at long intervals (SPACED mode)\n",
    "QuinCe determine the length between measurements and use that as the interpolation limit instead of five minutes. This will result in QuinCe finding the closest values within that time and interpolate between them. If there is no value within that time (e.g. if the sensor skipped one measurement), then QuinCe will not look further to find a usable value. Flagged values will be treated as for the short interval situation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groups of measurements at long intervals (GROUP PLUS SLEEP mode)\n",
    "In this situation QuinCe will not treat values individually. Instead the values from each group will be averaged, and then those averages will be treated as single values and interpolated per 'Regular single measurements at long intervals'. This will happen even if the required timestamp falls within one of the groups of measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "When grouping measurements, any values flagged Questionable or Bad will be excluded from the mean, so only Good values are used. If only Questionable or Bad values are availble in a group then that flag will be applied to the calculated mean value (and passed on to the calculation result). If no values are available to construct a mean within the time limit of the longer period, then QuinCe will not look beyond that limit. Selecting values according to their flags is beyond the scope of this notebook, which is purely for understanding the measurement grouping algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* When calibration gas standards are processed, these are averaged within their group. However, this calculation is independent of the detection of the measurement mode and does not need to be considered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining GROUP PLUS SLEEP and SPACED\n",
    "In practice, the SPACED mode can be treated in exactly the same way as the GROUP PLUS SLEEP mode, since this is conceptually the same with groups of only one measurement. Therefore SPACED mode will not be used further in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining which strategy to use\n",
    "This notebook contains the algorithm for determining which of the above strategies will be used. The first part of the notebook is a step-by-step guide to how the algorithm works, and the second part runs the complete algorithm for a number of different scenarios."
