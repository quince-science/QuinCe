# QuinCe
QuinCe is a system for the collection, processing, quality control and publication
of a variety of data streams, mostly focused on marine biogeochemical data but
designed to be able to handle almost anything.

See [Documentation/setup.md](https://github.com/quince-science/QuinCe/blob/master/Documentation/setup.md) for installation details.
