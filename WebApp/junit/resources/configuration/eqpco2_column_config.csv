# Column configurations for QuinCe QC Records

# The format of this file is CSV, with columns as follows:
#
# 1. Column Name
# 2. Data Type: One of S (String), N (Numeric), B (Boolean). Times should be set as Strings and parsed by the code.
# 3. Required: True if a value is required, false otherwise. If a Boolean is empty it is assumed false.
# 4. Flag Cascade: Flags placed on a column can cascade to other columns. (See below.)

# Flag Cascading
#
# When a flag is set on a column, it can cascade to other columns. The specification is as follows:
#
# <Target column name>|<Flag to set on Questionable>|<Flag to set on Bad>
#
# Multiple columns can be specified separated by semi-colons.
#
#
# An example:
#
# Salinity,N,Y,Mean Salinity|3|4;fCO2|2|3
#
# This is the entry for a Salinity column. If its flag is set to Questionable, then the Mean Salinity column
# is also assigned a Questionable flag, while the fCO2 column is assigned a Good flag.
# For a Bad Salinity, Mean Salinity is set to Bad, and fCO2 is set to Questionable.
#
# Note that these cascades will only set flags if they are 'worse' than the flag that is already set, i.e.
# Good -> Questionable -> Bad
#
# A Questionable flag cascading to a column that already has a Bad flag will have no effect.
